To-Do
1. Get four seperate pages working that we can navigate through with different urls
2. Set up nav bar
3. Set up PouchDB for local storage
4. Handle the CSS for each page (decide on layout, colors, what it should look like)
5. On the main page rotate through images or charts to show we can use JS for the back-end(data mocking)
6. Make sure to document all functions/comment well
7. Every one has to do something
