- On the home page there are two ways to navigate to a different page, one way is by the menu button the other way is entering any company's ticker into the search bar and pressing enter.

- To access the data for a specific company enter that specific company's name into the search bar and press enter.

- Currently, the server on the watchlist page does not work for x86-64 chipset users.
- The watchlist page is for looking at the numbers and data for the most recent trading day and navigating through the menu button on any page.
- Stocks can be added to the watchlist on the specific company's page by a button, navigated to by entering that company's ticker into the search bar.

- The AboutUs page, which you can navigate to from the menu button, shows a brief description of the people who worked on the project.
