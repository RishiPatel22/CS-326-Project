        <h2>Overview</h2>
             <p>Our web application, a Stock Trading Dashboard, aims to provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring real-time stock prices, conducting company searches, and performing stock analysis. Catering to both individual investors and finance professionals, the platform addresses the challenge of accessing timely and reliable stock market information.</p>
             <p>With a search function, users can quickly find information on any company listed on the stock exchange, facilitating research and decision-making processes. Additionally, analytical tools offer insights into stock performance and trends.</p>
             <p>By combining real-time data visualization with powerful analysis capabilities, our project aims to enhance the trading experience for a broad audience, contributing to a better world of stock trading.</p>

         <h2>Application Parts</h2>
             <p>In our application we hope to have some type of search feature for finding each company listed on the stock market, then be able to access a real-time chart for that specific company. </p>
             <p>We also want to the web application to have a feature were you can "favorite" or "add to watch list" a certain company to have it displayed in a certain area in the web app. We hope to have this saved between sessions, i.e. if you leave the site nothing will be changed from the last time you opened the web application. </p>
             <p>We hope to also include a feature that allows the user to see the loss/gain over any certain period of time, not just days also time within the days, this will be the hardest part to find an API for.</p>

         <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
         <p>Our Stock Trading Dashboard addresses the real-world challenge of accessing reliable and timely stock market information. In today's world, getting access to realtime stock analysis data has never been easier for those who know how to leverage modern api's and technologies yet for the average layperson, it has never been more complicated. With this app, the average person can make informed decision when looking to invest, trade, or simply study a particular stock.</p>

        <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        <p>Throughout our university experience, we have been exposed to a variety of fields including politics, literature, and the arts. We have chosen to showcase our knowledge through our non-computer science experiences and personal passions for finance, design, and modern-day events.</p>
        <p>Within this project, we will demonstrate how web development can be combined with these factors to create a cohesive product. In our experience, we believe using cumulative knowledge from different fields creates a better user experience. Many financial analysis applications lack user-friendly design, appealing to a vast majority of people; many of these applications also lack the background information on modern events needed to make an educated analysis.</p>
        <p>We hope to create an application that can alleviate these real-world problems using our collective knowledge of finance, design, and modern events, in combination with our experience in web development.</p>
