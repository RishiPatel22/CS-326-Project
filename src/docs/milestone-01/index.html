        <h2>Overview</h2>
             <p>Our web application, a Stock Trading Dashboard, aims to provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring real-time stock prices, conducting company searches, and performing stock analysis. Catering to both individual investors and finance professionals, the platform addresses the challenge of accessing timely and reliable stock market information.</p>
             <p>With a search function, users can quickly find information on any company listed on the stock exchange, facilitating research and decision-making processes. Additionally, analytical tools offer insights into stock performance and trends.</p>
             <p>By combining real-time data visualization with powerful analysis capabilities, our project aims to enhance the trading experience for a broad audience, contributing to a better world of stock trading.</p>

         <h2>Application Parts</h2>
             <p>In our application we hope to have some type of search feature for finding each company listed on the stock market, then be able to access a real-time chart for that specific company. </p>
             <p>We also want to the web application to have a feature were you can "favorite" or "add to watchlist" a certain company to have it displayed in a certain area in the web app. We hope to have this saved between sessions, i.e. if you leave the site nothing will be changed from the last time you opened the web application. </p>
             <p>We hope to also include a feature that allows the user to see the loss/gain over any certain period of time, not just days also time within the days, this will be the hardest part to find an API for.</p>

         <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
         <p>Our Stock Trading Dashboard addresses the real-world challenge of accessing reliable and timely stock market information. In today's world, getting access to realtime stock analysis data has never been easier for those who know how to leverage modern api's and technologies yet for the average layperson, it has never been more complicated. With this app, the average person can make informed decision when looking to invest, trade, or simply study a particular stock.</p>

        <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        <p>Our Stock Trading Dashboard project represents a comprehensive integration of various technologies, methodologies, and concepts that we have learned and applied throughout our academic journey. It serves as a culmination of our skills in web development, data visualization, user interface design, and project management.</p>
        <p>Through this project, we aim to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, leveraging modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development, Node.js for backend functionalities, and APIs for real-time stock data retrieval.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, our integrative experience extends beyond technical aspects. As a team, we have cultivated effective communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills, essential for successful project execution. We have embraced agile methodologies, conducted regular meetings, and iteratively refined our project to meet user needs and project goals.</p>
        <p>This integrative experience not only enhances our technical proficiency but also prepares us for future challenges in software development and collaborative projects, ensuring a holistic learning experience.</p>
